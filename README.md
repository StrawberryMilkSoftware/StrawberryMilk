Welcome to the official GitHub page for the **Strawberry Milk Programming Language!** *(SMPL)*

## What is strawberryMilk?
strawberryMilk is a programming language that is designed to simplify more complicated Python syntax into shorter pieces.

*Example:*
To universally clear the screen in Python, you would do:
```
import os

def clear():
  if os.name == "nt":
    os.system("cls")
  else:
    os.system("clear")
    
clear()
```

In strawberryMilk, all you have to do is:
```
clear()
```
